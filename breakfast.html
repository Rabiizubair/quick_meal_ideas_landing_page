    <p>
        Classic egg in a hole is made inside a waffle for a sweet, buttery flavor and added crunch.
    </p>

    <p>
        Youâ€™ll love the sweet and savory flavors in this easy, all-in-one breakfast. This fun twist on classic
        egg-in-a-hole is air fried for easy cooking and clean-up. Plus, the frozen waffle cut-out serves as the cutest
        dipper for scooping up the soft egg. Personalize it with your breakfast favorites, like shredded Parmesan, bacon
        bits, or even hot sauce.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>1 frozen waffle</li>

        <li>1 large egg</li>

        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons shredded cheese</li>

        <li>maple syrup to taste</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Directions</h1>

    <h2>Step 1</h2>

    <p>
        Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2</h2>

    <p>
        Cut a hole in the center of the frozen waffle using the rim of a cup or glass (about 2 to 3 inches in diameter).
        Move waffle to a square of parchment paper, then carefully place the parchment paper into the preheated air
        fryer, along with the small center waffle.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3</h2>

    <p>
        Crack egg directly into the center of waffle hole; season with salt and pepper to taste. Close the lid and cook
        until the white of the egg has started to set, about 5 to 6 minutes.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 4</h2>

    <p>
        Remove small center waffle from the air fryer. Sprinkle shredded cheese onto egg waffle, and cook until the
        cheese is melted and egg white is completely set, about 1 to 2 minutes.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 5</h2>

    <p>
        Transfer egg waffle onto a plate; drizzle with maple syrup and serve immediately.
