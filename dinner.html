    </p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>

        <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste</li>

        <li>1 pinch Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®), or more to taste</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon chicken broth, or more to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h1>Directions</h1>

    <h2>Step 1</h2>

    <p>
        Gather all ingredients.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2</h2>

    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3</h2>

    <p>
        Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a
        broiler pan.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 4</h2>

    <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the
        juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
        least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
    </p>

    <h2>Step 5</h2>

    <p>
        Remove chicken to a plate.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 6</h2>

    <p>
        Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add
        more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 7</h2>

    <p>
        To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.
    </p>

    <h1>Tips</h1>

    <p>
        You can use water instead of chicken broth for the pan sauce.
