    <p>
        These Buffalo chicken pastry sliders take very little time and effort and are a great party treat.
    </p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (17.3 oz package) frozen puff pastry (such as Pepperidge Farm®), thawed</li>

        <li>1 1/2 cups buffalo chicken dip,</li>

        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

        <li>hot sauce to taste (such as Frank’s® Buffalo Sauce or Frank’s® Hot Sauce)</li>

        <li>1/4 cup finely diced celery</li>

        <li>1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese</li>

        <li>blue cheese dressing for dipping (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Directions</h1>

    <h2>Step 1</h2>

    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2</h2>

    <p>
        Cut each pastry sheet into 6 rectangles. Stir together buffalo chicken dip and cheese in a bowl. Place a heaping
        dollop (about 2 tablespoons) chicken mixture in the center of each pastry square, allowing for all 4 sides of
        the pastry to be exposed. Set on the prepared baking sheet.
    </p>

    <h2> Step 3 </h2>

    <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven until sliders are puffed and golden, 10 to 15 minutes.
    </p>

    <h2> Step 4 </h2>

    <p>
        Top each pastry with a drizzle of hot sauce. Sprinkle each pastry evenly with celery and blue cheese and serve
        with ranch dressing if desired.
    </p>

    <h1>Cook's Note:</h1>

    <p>
        Instead of mozzarella cheese you can also use shredded Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese.
